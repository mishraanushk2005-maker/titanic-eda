## 🚢 Titanic Dataset – EDA Summary

The Titanic dataset contains passenger information such as age, gender, class, fare, and survival status.  
The objective of this analysis is to explore the data, understand patterns, and identify key factors that influenced survival.

## 🧹 What I Did on the Dataset

- Loaded and explored the dataset to understand structure and features
- Identified **numerical** and **categorical** columns
- Checked missing values and handled them appropriately
- Performed **univariate analysis** to study individual features
- Performed **bivariate analysis** to understand relationships with survival
- Visualized data using **bar plots, histograms, and distribution plots**
- Analyzed survival trends based on:
  - Gender
  - Passenger Class (Pclass)
  - Age
  - Fare

---

## 📊 Key Observations

- **Gender:** Female passengers had a significantly higher survival rate than males
- **Passenger Class:** First-class passengers survived more compared to second and third class
- **Age:** Children had better survival chances than older passengers
- **Fare:** Passengers who paid higher fares were more likely to survive
- **Missing Data:** Age and Cabin columns contained missing values, which required careful handling
